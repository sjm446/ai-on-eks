:::warning
Deployment of ML models on EKS requires access to GPUs or Neuron instances. If your deployment isn't working, it's often due to missing access to these resources. Also, some deployment patterns rely on Karpenter autoscaling and static node groups; if nodes aren't initializing, check the logs for Karpenter or Node groups to resolve the issue.

## What is NVIDIA Dynamo?

[NVIDIA Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) is an open-source inference framework designed to optimize performance and scalability for large language models (LLMs) and generative AI applications. Released under the Apache 2.0 license, Dynamo provides a datacenter-scale distributed inference serving framework that orchestrates complex AI workloads across multiple GPUs and nodes.

### What is an Inference Graph?

An **inference graph** is a computational workflow that defines how AI models process data through interconnected nodes, enabling complex multi-step AI operations like:
- **LLM chains**: Sequential processing through multiple language models
- **Multimodal processing**: Combining text, image, and audio processing
- **Custom inference pipelines**: Tailored workflows for specific AI applications
- **Disaggregated serving**: Separating prefill and decode phases for optimal resource utilization

## Overview

This blueprint uses the **[official NVIDIA Dynamo Helm charts](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-dynamo/helm-charts/dynamo-platform)** from the [NVIDIA NGC catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-dynamo/collections/ai-dynamo), with additional shell scripts and Terraform automation to simplify the deployment process on Amazon EKS.

### Deployment Approach

**Why This Setup Process?**
While this implementation involves multiple steps, it provides several advantages over a simple Helm-only deployment:

- **Complete Infrastructure**: Automatically provisions VPC, EKS cluster, ECR repositories, and monitoring stack
- **Production Ready**: Includes enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and scalability features
- **AWS Integration**: Leverages EKS autoscaling, EFA networking, and AWS services
- **Customizable**: Allows fine-tuning of GPU node pools, networking, and resource allocation
- **Reproducible**: Infrastructure as Code ensures consistent deployments across environments

**For Simpler Deployments**: If you already have an EKS cluster and prefer a minimal setup, you can use the Dynamo Helm charts directly from the source repository. This blueprint provides the full production-ready experience.

As LLMs and generative AI applications become increasingly prevalent, the demand for efficient, scalable, and low-latency inference solutions has grown. Traditional inference systems often struggle to meet these demands, especially in distributed, multi-node environments. NVIDIA Dynamo addresses these challenges by offering innovative solutions to optimize performance and scalability with support for AWS services such as Amazon S3, Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), and Amazon EKS.

  ],
  "created": 1752018267,
  "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B",
  "object": "chat.completion"
}
```

## Monitor and Observe

### Grafana Dashboard

Access Grafana for visualization (default port 3000):

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n kube-prometheus-stack svc/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana 3000:80
```

### Prometheus Metrics

Access Prometheus for metrics collection (port 9090):

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n kube-prometheus-stack svc/prometheus 9090:80
```

### Automatic Monitoring

The deployment automatically creates:

- **ServiceMonitor**: Configures Prometheus to scrape metrics
- **Dashboards**: Pre-configured Grafana dashboards for inference monitoring

## Advanced Configuration

### Version Management

The deployment automatically manages Dynamo versions with flexible override options:

**Default Behavior:**
- Reads version from `terraform/blueprint.tfvars` (`dynamo_stack_version = "v0.4.0"`)
- Automatically updates container image tags in YAML manifests
- Creates temporary manifests without modifying source files

**Override Options:**
```bash
# Environment variable (highest priority)
export DYNAMO_VERSION=v0.4.0
./deploy.sh vllm

# Inline override
DYNAMO_VERSION=v0.4.0 ./deploy.sh sglang

# Update terraform/blueprint.tfvars (persistent)
dynamo_stack_version = "v0.4.0"
```

**Supported Versions:**
- **v0.4.0**: Current stable release (default)
- Custom versions from private builds

### Custom Model Deployment

To deploy custom models, modify the configuration files in `dynamo/examples/llm/configs/`:

1. **Choose Architecture**: Select based on model size and requirements
2. **Update Configuration**: Edit the appropriate YAML file
3. **Set Model Parameters**: Update `model` and `served_model_name` fields
4. **Configure Resources**: Adjust GPU allocation and memory settings

**Example for DeepSeek-R1 70B model:**

```yaml
Common:
  model: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B
  max-model-len: 32768
  tensor-parallel-size: 4

Frontend:
  served_model_name: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B

VllmWorker:
  ServiceArgs:
    resources:
      gpu: '4'
```


### Configuration Options

The main configuration is in `terraform/blueprint.tfvars`:

```hcl
# Required for Dynamo deployment
enable_dynamo_stack = true
enable_argocd       = true

# Dynamo platform version
dynamo_stack_version = "v0.4.0"

# Required infrastructure components
enable_aws_efs_csi_driver        = true
enable_aws_efa_k8s_device_plugin = true
enable_ai_ml_observability_stack = true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GPU Nodes Not Available**: Check Karpenter logs and instance availability
2. **Pod Failures**: Check resource limits and cluster capacity  
3. **Model Download Failures**: Verify HuggingFace token and network connectivity
4. **API 503 Errors**: Wait for model loading or check worker health

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check cluster status
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n dynamo-cloud

# View logs
kubectl logs -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server
kubectl logs -n dynamo-cloud -l app=vllm-worker

# Check deployments
kubectl get dynamographdeployment -n dynamo-cloud
kubectl describe dynamographdeployment <name> -n dynamo-cloud
```

## Node Selection and Customization

### Selecting Instance Types

You can customize which Karpenter node pool your Dynamo components deploy to by modifying the `nodeSelector` in your DynamoGraphDeployment:

```yaml
# Example: Deploy GPU worker to G5 instances
VllmWorker:
  extraPodSpec:
    nodeSelector:
      karpenter.sh/nodepool: g5-gpu-karpenter
  resources:
    requests:
      gpu: "1"

# Example: Deploy frontend to CPU instances      
Frontend:
  extraPodSpec:
    nodeSelector:
      karpenter.sh/nodepool: cpu-karpenter
```

**Available Node Pools** (configured in base infrastructure):
- `g5-gpu-karpenter`: G5 instances with NVIDIA A10G GPUs
- `g6-gpu-karpenter`: G6 instances with NVIDIA L4 GPUs (if configured)
- `cpu-karpenter`: CPU-only instances for frontends

### Custom Development

For advanced customization and development:

1. **Source Code**: Full Dynamo source code is available at [~/dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) with comprehensive documentation and examples
2. **Blueprint Examples**: Each example in the `blueprints/inference/nvidia-dynamo/` folder includes detailed README files
3. **Container Source**: All source code is included in NGC containers at `/workspace/` for in-container customization

Refer to the individual README files in each blueprint example for specific customization guidance.
